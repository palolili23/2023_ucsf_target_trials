### Randomized trials

Experiment in which participants are randomly assigned to follow specified treatment strategies.

--

**Ideal randomized trial**:

   + No loss to follow-up

   + Full adherence through out the study duration

   + Double blind assignment

--

Usually they following time points are aligned by design:

- Eligibility criteria

- Treatment assignment (randomization)

- Follow-up starts

???
Counterfactual or potential outcomes, Causal diagrams (e.g., DAGs, SWIGs)
The concept of an “ideal randomized trial” is tied directly to these languages

Under this design, comparing the observed average outcomes under each treatment arm is the same as comparing what would have happened had everybody been in one treatment arm versus the other

## Target trial emulation
--

- Conceptualize the hypothetical randomized trial we would like to conduct that answers our question

--

- Describe the protocol elements of that target trial

--

- Emulate the target trial with observational data as close as possible

Now, you may feel skeptical about this framework if you are not working specifically in pharmacoepi. Most of the modifiable risk factors are not easy to conceptualize as treatment arms in a trial. 
I hope my work here helps moving out from that dilemma and using the core concepts of this framework to improve the way ask questions and seek responses with observational studies.

But first, lets start with a case where we are actually interested in repurposing a drug for dementia prevention.

Frequently, observational studies that don't conceptualize the target trial self inflict with bias due to time-zero missalignment, or other sources of bias

### Rotterdam study

![](figs/rs.png)
???

RS is a population-based cohort that recruited participants living in the district of Ommoord, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The cohort was recruited from all inhabitants aged 55 years and older. Participants were invited in random clusters, through sampling from the municipal registerfull recruitment and complete data acquisition started in January, 1990.
In 1999, members of Ommoord who had become 55 years of age or moved into the study district since the recruitment were invited to participate; out of 4472 invitees, 3011 new participants were included to the Rotterdam Study[@hofman2007] between February 1999 and December

---
### Methods

- New user design, using nested trials

--

- Inverse probability treatment weights

--

- Pooled logistic regression as a parametric alternative for time to event analysis

--

- Death as a censoring event (IPCW for exchangeability)

--

- Software: SAS _Initiators macro_*

### Intention to treat (Q1) vs. <br> per protocol effect (Q2)


.center[

![](figs/statins.png)
]

**10 year-dementia risk difference:** <br> -0.1% (-2.3%, 1.8%) vs -2.2% (-5.2%, 1.6%)

---
### Discussion

- Our findings suggest a potential decreased risk of dementia and dementia or death after sustained statin use compared with no statin use (the per-protocol analysis analogue).

--

- A per-protocol effect with more clinically-relevant discontinuation rules would be more insightful.

--

- There is still potential confounding by indication (at baseline and time-varying) and differential measurement error in dementia diagnosis.

.footnote[
<br><br>
**A** = SBP, **L** = _Fixed covariates_: age, sex, education, SBP, history of diabetes and heart disease. _Time-varying covariates_: visit process, smoking status, SBP, BMI, HT medication, total cholesterol and diagnosis of diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson disease, Parkinsonism, TIA, dementia or cancer, **Y** = Stroke / Dementia]

---
### Methods

1. Model each variable (A, L, Y, D) using the covariate history.

--

2. Select a random sample of baseline data and simulate covariate and treatment history using estimated coefficients from step 1.

--

3. Intervene by assigning the treatment value at each time point according to the hypothetical intervention.

--

4. Estimate the predicted probability of the outcome based on the updated intervention.

--

5. Calculate the average of the subject-specific risks and bootstrap CI.

--

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each hypothetical intervention.

### Discussion

- Lowering blood pressure and quitting smoking reduces the risk of stroke, as described previously in literature.

--

- We did not observe the same effect in dementia, though the effect may be mediated on how interventions decrease the risk of death.

--

Estimates rely on important assumptions:

  + Time-varying data was sufficient

  + No modeling misspecification (consider data generation process)

### Current challenges

<br>

- Differential missclasification of dementia, QBA?

--

- Modelling challenges for Chinese Americans.

--

- Intervention is limited to a shorter length of time than the outcome.

---

### A note on well-defined interventions

<br><br>

- There is a long standing debate on what classifies as "well-defined" or "ill-defined".

--

- In the studies of lowering blood pressure we did not specified how SBP would be lowered, this represents a weighted average of strategies, determined by the frequency of these in the studied population.

--

- The target trial framework helps us in being more transparent about our questions, assumptions and interpretations.

--

- This POV can help us study social determinants in new ways.

---

## Take aways


- Having a clear question (or estimand) is key to conceptualize the best study design that answers it. 
  
--

- We can use the target trial framework even if we don’t have the intervention of interested measured (or discovered).

--

- Specifying the components of the target trial should be one of the first steps prior to the outline of an analysis plan that emulates such trial. 

--

- We can prevent several sources of bias from having a better design, and we can identify other sources of bias that can prevented (or quantified) through the analytic strategies.

--

- It is a dynamic process, since it requires a deep understanding of the data sources and a constant check that the causal contrasts and subsequent results are informative.
